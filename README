This analysis is divided into two parts:
1. part: Looking for all pion-kaon pairs that are later saved to ROOT file.
2. part: Reconstruction of D0 candidates from the previous ROOT file and later D-jets reconstruction.
--------------------------------------------
3. part: This separated part is for the mapping of bad towers.
